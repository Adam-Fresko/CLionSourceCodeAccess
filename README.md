# CLionSourceCodeAccess
A CLion Plugin for Unreal Engine

The plugin creates a fully flushed out CMakeList file for use with CLion, adding intellisense, compiler definitions, etc.

Please visit https://github.com/dotBunny/CLionSourceCodeAccess/wiki for information on how to install and use the plugin.

## IMPORTANT
The plugin has been modified to not list Win64 as a whitelisted platform due to the current problems building from Windows. If you want to experiment check this [commit](https://github.com/dotBunny/CLionSourceCodeAccess/commit/9bf1de60e1b5657bc55f980e62658044ca63dc8a) out to see how to turn it back on. This is only temporary, until a fix has been found for Windows.
